          <br />
          I am sorry meghuu for being very late but I love youuu and i wish you a very happy rose day. You know very well that you are the favourite rose of my life. 
          
          On this Rose Day, no flower in the world could ever match your beauty, your warmth, or the way you make my heart bloom with happiness. Every petal of a rose whispers your name, every fragrance reminds me of your embrace. If I could, Iâ€™d give you a garden full of rosesâ€”each one carrying a promise of my love, forever and always. You are my most precious bloom, my sweetest dream, my forever.
          <br />
